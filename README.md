# Seat Arrangement Algorithm

Write a backend API with an endpoint that helps seat audiences in a flight based on the following input and rules. 
Code must be accompanied by tests.

## Rules for seating:

 - Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back, starting from the left to the right
 - Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center seats (any order in center seats)
 
### Input
 - a 2D array that represents the rows and columns e.g: [[3,4], [4,5], [2,3], [3,4]]
 - The number of passengers waiting in the queue.
 
### Output

It is up to you, keep in mind that you need to assume this backend endpoint will be used by a frontend developer.

## Do

 - Use any framework or tools, give reasons why do you think it is the perfect tools for this assignment
 - Follow coding best practices/conventions that you are familiar with
 - Think of it as a real project deliverable and that the API will be consumed by other developers
 - Code must be accompanied by tests
 - Please provide instructions on how to run and build the project on README.md
 - Make sure reviewers can easily set it up and review it
